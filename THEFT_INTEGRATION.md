# Theft Property-Based Testing Integration

## Overview

This document describes the successful integration of the [theft property-based testing library](https://github.com/silentbicycle/theft) into the JSON Diff C project, replacing traditional fuzzing and generative testing approaches with systematic property-based testing.

## What is Property-Based Testing?

Property-based testing is a testing methodology where instead of writing specific test cases with hardcoded inputs and expected outputs, you define **properties** (general rules) that should always hold true for your code, and the testing framework automatically generates thousands of test cases to try to find counter-examples.

For example, instead of testing:
```c
assert(reverse(reverse([1,2,3])) == [1,2,3])  // specific case
```

You test:
```c
for any list L: reverse(reverse(L)) == L  // general property
```

## Integration Details

### 1. Theft Library Setup ✅

**Location**: `vendor/theft/`
- Cloned theft library as a vendor dependency
- Built using theft's native Makefile system
- Integrated with project's Meson build system
- Automatic detection - tests are included when theft is available, gracefully skipped when not

**Build Integration**:
```meson
theft_lib = meson.get_compiler('c').find_library('theft',
  dirs: [join_paths(meson.current_source_dir(), 'vendor/theft/build')],
  required: false)

if theft_lib.found()
  # Build theft-based tests
else
  message('theft library not found, skipping property-based tests')
endif
```

### 2. Property-Based Tests ✅

**File**: `tests/test_theft_properties.c`

Implements systematic property-based testing for core JSON diff operations:

#### Property 1: Self-Diff Identity
```c
// For any JSON value j: diff(j, j) should return NULL
static enum theft_trial_res prop_self_diff_is_null(struct theft *t, void *arg1)
```
- **Rationale**: A value should have no difference with itself
- **Trials**: 1,000 generated JSON structures
- **Status**: ✅ PASS

#### Property 2: Diff-Patch Roundtrip
```c
// For any JSON values j1, j2: patch(j1, diff(j1, j2)) should equal j2
static enum theft_trial_res prop_diff_patch_roundtrip(struct theft *t, void *arg1, void *arg2)
```
- **Rationale**: Applying a diff should recreate the target state
- **Trials**: 1,000 pairs of JSON structures
- **Status**: ✅ PASS (with appropriate null handling)

#### Property 3: Diff Existence Symmetry
```c
// diff(j1, j2) exists if and only if diff(j2, j1) exists
static enum theft_trial_res prop_diff_symmetry(struct theft *t, void *arg1, void *arg2)
```
- **Rationale**: If two values differ, both directions should produce diffs
- **Trials**: 1,000 pairs of JSON structures
- **Status**: ✅ PASS

#### Property 4: Equality Consistency
```c
// json_value_equal should be consistent with diff behavior
static enum theft_trial_res prop_equality_consistency(struct theft *t, void *arg1, void *arg2)
```
- **Rationale**: Equal values should produce no diff, unequal values should produce diffs
- **Trials**: 1,000 pairs with both strict and loose equality modes
- **Status**: ✅ PASS

#### Property 5: Crash Safety
```c
// All operations should complete without crashing
static enum theft_trial_res prop_no_crashes(struct theft *t, void *arg1, void *arg2)
```
- **Rationale**: Library should handle any input gracefully
- **Trials**: 2,000 operations across different configurations
- **Status**: ✅ PASS

### 3. Structured Fuzzing ✅

**File**: `tests/test_theft_fuzzing.c`

Implements three complementary fuzzing strategies:

#### Strategy 1: Structured JSON Fuzzing
- Generates complex but syntactically valid JSON structures
- Tests with nested objects, arrays, various data types
- Includes edge cases like empty structures, special numbers, Unicode strings
- **Trials**: 5,000 structured JSON pairs

#### Strategy 2: Binary Data Fuzzing
- Generates raw binary data and attempts to parse as JSON
- Tests parser robustness against malformed input
- Includes null bytes, control characters, invalid UTF-8
- **Trials**: 3,000 binary data pairs

#### Strategy 3: Malformed JSON String Fuzzing
- Generates partially valid JSON strings with intentional syntax errors
- Tests combinations of valid JSON fragments with random data
- Includes unclosed braces, invalid escape sequences, truncated structures
- **Trials**: 4,000 JSON string pairs

### 4. Advanced JSON Generation

The theft integration includes sophisticated JSON generation logic:

```c
static cJSON *generate_json_value(struct theft *t, int depth, int max_depth)
{
    // Intelligent type selection based on depth
    // Prevents infinite recursion with depth limits
    // Generates realistic edge cases
    // Balances simple and complex structures
}
```

**Features**:
- **Depth-aware generation**: Prevents stack overflow with configurable depth limits
- **Weighted type selection**: Biases toward realistic JSON structures
- **Edge case injection**: Intentionally includes problematic values (large numbers, special characters, empty strings)
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of generated structures

### 5. Shrinking and Counter-Example Reduction

Theft automatically reduces failing test cases to minimal examples:

```c
static enum theft_shrink_res json_shrink(struct theft *t,
                                          const void *instance,
                                          uint32_t tactic,
                                          void *env,
                                          void **output)
{
    switch (tactic) {
    case 0: // Try to replace with null
    case 1: // Try to replace with empty object/array
    case 2: // Try to shrink array by removing elements
    case 3: // Try to shrink object by removing fields
    case 4: // Try to shrink strings
    }
}
```

**Shrinking Strategies**:
- Replace complex values with `null`
- Replace non-empty containers with empty ones
- Remove array elements (preserving order)
- Remove object fields
- Truncate strings
- Multiple tactics applied systematically

### 6. Test Execution and Reporting

**Sample Output**:
```
